Backend Team Prompt
Here's what to tell your backend team:

BACKEND VIDEO PLAYBACK & DOWNLOAD FIX

Problem:

Videos are being generated and saved in /uploads folder but cannot be accessed by the frontend
Both video playback in browser and download are failing with 405 Method Not Allowed
The backend is rejecting GET requests to /uploads/ and /api/avatar/download/
Required Fixes:

Serve /uploads folder as static files (this is critical)

Make all files in the /uploads directory accessible via HTTP GET requests
URLs should be like: http://localhost:3000/uploads/avatar_filename.mp4
Return complete video URLs from the generate endpoint

When /api/avatar/generate completes, return the video_url in the response
The video_url should be the full accessible path the frontend can use:
Example: /uploads/avatar_7684cdc0.mp4 (relative) or
Example: http://localhost:3000/uploads/avatar_7684cdc0.mp4 (absolute)
Do NOT return /api/avatar/download/ paths - these endpoints are returning 405
Add CORS headers (if frontend is on different port)

Ensure /uploads/* routes allow GET requests from the frontend origin
Test the fix

Verify: GET http://localhost:3000/uploads/any_video_file.mp4 returns 200 and serves the file
Verify: The generate endpoint returns a working video_url in the response
Once these are fixed, the frontend will:

✅ Play videos in the browser
✅ Allow users to download videos
That's the prompt to give them! Let me know when they fix it. 👍
